# About this course

## What this course IS

A one-month short course from [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/)

* You get a taste of programming with JavaScript - one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages today.
* You'll learn fundamentals of programming that can be applied to JavaScript and other languages.
* You'll get to find out if you actually LIKE programming!
* You'll become familiar with some free on-line resources that we recommend to help in future study.

We'll also look at what you can make with programming and what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

### Concept Roadmap

If you want more detail about the topics that we're covering, take a look at the [concept roadmap](other-resources/roadmap-of-concepts.md)

### About further study on CYF's web-development course:

At the end of this short course,

* if you decide programming is definitely for you
* and if we think you're ready

there will be the possibility to apply for further study on the next full-stack web development course.

Whether you take that path or not, we want this course to be useful to you.

## What this course is NOT

### It's _not_ a web development course

Although we'll certainly learn some JavaScript - the most popular language in web development - we won't do _any_ web development with it!

### It's _not_ a teacher-led course

We're not going to lecture you.

You will work through some online courses, and we \(or the people sitting around you\) will help you when you're really stuck.

### â€¦ and we're _not_ starting with JavaScript!

We'll start to look at JavaScript in week 2. First we're going to use a simpler language to learn and practice fundamentals.
