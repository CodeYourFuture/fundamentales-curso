# Workshop on migrating to p5.js

## \(Rough\) workshop outline - migrating to p5.js and openprocessing.org

Bookmark [Neill's longer notes on migrating from khan academy's processing.js to p5.js](from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md). You can read them at home.

Make an account on [openprocessing.org](https://openprocessing.org)

Create a "sketch"

Run it, edit it

Change colours, sizes, etc, for a couple of minutes

rename it, save it

[Browse the gallery](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/#)

Find two sketches you like, show them to your classroom neighbour.

Follow [neill](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/135249/) and [ali](p5js-and-openprocessing-workshop.md) \(TODO: ali what user number?\)

Join the class so we can share future work: [https://www.openprocessing.org/class/61910](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/61910) \(Ask Neill or Ali for the access code.\)

Play with [this starting sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812085)

* read the code - do you understand every line?
* change something about it!
* press fork/"create a fork" \(the equivalent of "spin-off"\) and save it.  
* Change the title to reflect your work.

### audio analysis demos

Play with [this sketch processing audio from your microphone](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812282)

Play with and edit this \([simpler example of audio analysis](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812284/)\). What could you animate from your khan academy projects, with the different energies of bass, mid, and treble? Size, speed, rotation, colour, words, position, direction...

### web cam demos

Play with [this webcam-processing sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812361) and [this one, too](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812359). The first has hardly any code.

Play with [this posenet p5.js sketch on codepen](https://codepen.io/enz0/pen/wvBzoMN) - stand far back from the camera for best results! It is complicated, you don't need to understand it.

#### Pose-recognition from webcam - demo

\(This pose-recognition can't be done on openprocessing as it needs some other libraries \(ml5\) and openprocessing limits which libraries you can load.\)

### Documentation

Find the documentation [https://p5js.org/reference/](https://p5js.org/reference/)

Check out some examples - each function has multiple examples of how it can be used.

### Migrate one of your khan academy projects

Create a new sketch, and bring your favourite project across from khan academy.

You will need to consider [these notes about migrating from khan academy processing.js to p5.js](from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md#differences-between-khan-academy-processingjs-and-p5js)

## Other starting points

* If you really want to use codepen, here's a [p5.js starting "pen" in codepen](https://codepen.io/enz0/pen/vYEXyZr?editors=1010)
* If you want to see the whole picture of html and javascript together, [here's a website project on glitch](https://glitch.com/~cyf-p5js-start) with html, css, and javascript files.
