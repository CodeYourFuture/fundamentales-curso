# Lesson 4

## Warm up game

Some students will teach Zip-Zap-Boing to the others.

## Introductions

Let's make sure we know each other! Ask for a name tag if you don't already have one.

## Shout out your questions

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on the whiteboard. When you have time, put your initials next to the questions that interest you the most.

## Getting unstuck

We'll now spend 30 minutes where you can ask the volunteers with help on serious _questions that have really been blocking your progress_ through the Khan Academy course.

If you have other more advanced questions that aren't blocking you, please **don't** ask them yet \(unless you see that the volunteers are clearly not busy helping with more fundamental issues\). We'll have time later for those questions.

## Live coding

The instructor will do some _live-coding_ to demonstrate solutions to some of the class's common questions. This means they will be showing their screen on the projector and working on solving a problem. This is a very effective way to learn! The instructors are professionals and there are many small \(and large!\) tips you can pick up from them.

Can you spot the instructor's coding mistakes before they do? \(There will definitely be some, that is normal!\)

The instructor will likely ask for suggestions on how to do something from the class = speak up, it helps the their teaching. Don't worry about getting the answer "wrong" - there is no one correct way. They might also ask you to do some of the coding, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes!

_Tip_: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class to teach

## Present your favourite project to your classmates

You will give a very, very simple 2 minute presentation to 2 or 3 other students and a volunteer \(if one is available\). Before the presentations we'll have 5 minutes to prep. Pick your favourite project \(or the one that's most interesting to talk about\) and get ready to explain:

* What you added to it
* What was difficult
* What you like and don't like about it
* What you would add if you had time
* Any parts of the code you still don't understand and might want help with

With your group, find a quiet space, and set a stopwatch for 2 minutes and present.

If you need a reminder of how to give a good presentation, see [the tips from lesson 3](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/223d67a828fe3554aa7bcceb3bbc6f125a390e49/lesson-4/lesson-3.md#present-your-favourite-project-to-your-classmates.md)

## Improve your Khan Academy Projects with Arrays and Objects

Like last week, we'll work in _pairs_ to make the changes to your favourite Khan Academy you described in your presentation earlier. Remember that if you and your pair are totally stuck on something, ask a volunteer to help you - they're here to help!

If you have finished all of the Khan Academy projects up to and including the arrays and objects sections and you need some inspiration, [here is a list of further challenges](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/223d67a828fe3554aa7bcceb3bbc6f125a390e49/lesson-4/post-khan-academy-challenges.md). These mostly challenge you to return to an earlier project and make a spin-off which uses objects and/or arrays to make it better, cleaner, and to make it easier for you to do cooler things!

### Pair-programming \(2 students\)

It's good to code with a friend. You learn SO much. Programmers call this _pair programming_ and many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

If you need a reminder on how to pair-program effectively, see the [the notes from lesson 3](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/223d67a828fe3554aa7bcceb3bbc6f125a390e49/lesson-4/lesson-3.md#pair-programming).

## 1-to-1 programming problem with an instructor

Each student will have a pairing session with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Khan Academy Intro to JavaScript environment. We'll see how you're getting on, what help you need, and hopefully you'll get some tips from the instructor!

## Kahoot \(again\)

Let's do the first Kahoot quiz again, to find out if you feel any differently about programming now.

## Reflection: Zombies, plants, fish tanks, draw\(\) function... How is all this relevant in the real world?

Looking back at the [concept roadmap](../other-resources/roadmap-of-concepts.md), believe it or not, you've been learning the basics of programming, relevant to a whole range of coding jobs.

Now the instructors will look at specific elements you've learned about and how they're relevant elsewhere.

### Different JavaScript environments

Outside of the Khan Academy course platform, you'll see some differences in JavaScript:

* `let` and `const` used instead of `var`
* Functions can be created many ways \(the Khan Academy way is uncommon\)
* More features to learn about
* ...

## Other free resources

We'll have a look at some of our favourite free resources - both online and in person - which can help you towards a career in programming and web development.

### In-person events

* Coding "meetups"
  * Free evening events, with 2 - 3 talks from other developers
  * There is very often free pizza!
  * Don't be scared of these, just go!
  * Googling for "JavaScript meetup" or "Learn to code meetup" in your city is a good way to find these
* [Codebar](https://codebar.io/)
  * Meetup for people learning to code
  * Professional developers will help with your coding problems

### Online

* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
* Youtube: Some favourite channels of the recent graduates include [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX) and [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/user/wesbos). 
  * Find the teaching and learning style you like, but... [be cautious that you are not following tutorials blindly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_aMpyMvQ9k)
* [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#javascript)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * A forum for posting programming questions
  * It can be a little intimidating, but it has a huge community so someone is likely to know the answer to your question

### Podcasts

* [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)

### Editors and hosting

* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
* [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
* [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

### Program stepped visualisation

* [pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html) - it does JavaScript, too.

## Homework

Make sure you understand the homework for next week before you leave the classroom. See Google Classroom for the definitive list of homework assignments. Make sure you check it regularly.

### Khan Academy: Intro to JS

Finish the [Khan Academy: Intro to JS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

**IMPORTANT!!**

You should **SKIP** the "Object-Orientated Design" section. It is out-of-date and confusing!

### Learning How to Learn course

Continue to **Week 4** of the [Learning How to Learn course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It should take around 4 hours to complete.

## Continuing with JavaScript Drawing and Animation after this course

If you enjoyed using JavaScript to make drawings and animations, we recommend further study and play with the p5.js library, using the [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org) platform or CodePen.

Here are some [notes on moving to p5.js](../after-the-course/from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md).

If we have time, we will do [a short workshop on moving your work to to p5.js](../after-the-course/p5js-and-openprocessing-workshop.md).

### Some places to get inspiration with p5.js

Here is an essay by Jason Bailey about "generative art". It has lots of interesting examples which might inspire you: ["Why Love Generative Art?"](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art). If you use Twitter, here is a recommended "generative" artist: [https://twitter.com/manoloidee](https://twitter.com/manoloidee).

## End with a game or two

Suggestions:

* More Zip-Zap-Boing
