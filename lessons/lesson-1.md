# Lesson 2

## Warm up game

Some students will teach Zip-Zap-Boing to the others.

## Introductions

Let's make sure we know each other! Ask for a name tag if you don't already have one.

## Shout out your questions

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them on the whiteboard. When you have time, put your initials next to the questions that interest you the most.

## Solving problems

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

To help develop your problem solving skills, we'll play a fun game in small groups. Followed by a short [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XzLUVxfiJE2llWTWn7Rf5T0cutcL9HCBwd09GBCzv_4/) about improving your problem solving.

## "Algorithm recipe" review

Last week you should have written a "algorithm recipe". The instructor will pick out a few of the best to read with the rest of the class. We'll see if there are any missing steps!

## Homework presentation

For last week's homework, you will have made a presentation about something you learned in the last week. Now is your chance to present it! We'll break into groups of 3 - 4 and take turns to present to the rest of your group for **5 minutes**.

Remember that communicating information to others is a really important skill for programmers. Here are some tips for your presentation:

* Present to your classmates, not just to the volunteer
* Speak clearly
* Face the people you're talking to, as much as possible. Don't just face the screen
* Try to make it fun!
* Stick to the time. The volunteer will cut you off at 5 minutes!

## Homework in perspective - how is it applicable?

Although the block-based coding you practiced for homework solved only simple problems with a simple language, we'll look briefly at four concepts you used which are also at the heart of professional coding.

## Help with Homework Exercises

This is your opportunity to ask questions about last week's homework. If you would like some assistance on any of the exercises, the teaching assistants will be available to help.

## 1-to-1 programming problem with an instructor

Each student will have a work with one of the instructors to solve a programming problem using the Code.org block-programming environment.

## Homework

### Khan Academy: Intro to JS

We will be studying the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) Intro to JS course. This will give you an introduction to the JavaScript programming language which we will be using for the rest of the syllabus. To get set up follow these instructions:

1. Follow the instructions for registering a Khan Academy account provided by the instructors
2. Click on Courses under `My Stuff`
3. Choose `Adult learner` and go to the next step
4. Choose `Computer Programming` and continue
5. To the right of `Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation`, press Start
6. Click the "Start" button for the "What is Programming?" lesson
7. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete the exercises
8. Complete as many lessons as you can **AT LEAST UP TO** the ["Text and Strings" section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#text-basics). You can **SKIP** the "Becoming a community coder" section.
9. As soon as you complete any "project", make sure you submit it for evaluation immediately, to get feedback.

There will be some time in class to start the first exercises. Let the instructors know if you get stuck.

#### No headphones? Read the subtitles or video transcript

If you do not have headphones to watch the videos you can click on "CC" \(subtitles/closed captions\) in the video window, or underneath the video on "Transcript".

### Learning How to Learn course

Continue to **Week 2** of the [Learning How to Learn course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It should take around 3 hours to complete.
