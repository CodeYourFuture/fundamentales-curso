# Lesson 1

## Welcome

Welcome to Code Your Future and to the world of programming! Now that you have built a website in CodePen, we'll look at how the basics of how programming works, start writing our own programs and we'll also look at what you can make with programming and what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

## Introduction to Code Your Future

Before we get started with programming we want to learn a bit about you, and you can learn a bit about us.

We'll start with some introductions: so that we can get to know each other. We'll play some games including Zip-Zap-Boing and Happy Salmon.

## Code of Conduct & House Rules

While you're at Code Your Future, we expect you to follow some rules. This is so that **everyone** has a fun, productive and enjoyable experience.

We'll read through the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and [House Rules](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/house-rules.html) together and answer any questions you have about them.

## Getting into Technology: Why & How

Next we'll have a presentation about why you would want to be a programmer.

Link to the presentation slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XVVq6acZwMb7r1OAx2b54nS5WOguO3V7m7Pspledi60/edit\#slide=id.g253640fe83\_0\_202](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XVVq6acZwMb7r1OAx2b54nS5WOguO3V7m7Pspledi60/edit#slide=id.g253640fe83_0_202)

## What level is the class starting at?

If you've never programmed before, don't worry - you're definitely on the right course!

We'll do a 5-minute quiz to help us find out the class's level, using the fun app called ["Kahoot"](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023).

## Software Setup

Finally, to help us communicate with you during the course you'll need to install some software.

### Slack

1. Install Slack on your laptop \(and phone, if possible\)
2. Log in to the [Code Your Future Applicants workspace](https://cyf-applicants.slack.com/)

### The Golden rule of video calls on Slack & Google Meet

Whenever you are not talking, your microphone should be muted! This prevents distracting noise for the other participants.

### Google Classroom

To keep track of what homework you need to do and what you have completed we use Google Classroom. To set up your account:

1. Go to [classroom.google.com](https://classroom.google.com)
2. Log in to \(or create\) your Google account
3. Click the "+" button in the top right, then "Join class"
4. Paste in this classroom code that your instructor gives you and click "Join"

#### Submitting homework on Google Classroom

Once you have joined the class, click the "Classwork" button at the top. You will see the list of Week 1 homework. To submit homework:

1. Click on the piece of homework you have completed
2. Click the "View Assignment" button
3. Click the "Add or Create" button on the right hand side
4. Here you can provide a link to homework that you have completed, or upload a file

Go ahead and submit the first assignment now, "first assignment: what's your favourite music?", so that we can see Google Classroom is working for you!

## Tips for success

[Here is a list of some tips for success on the course](../other-resources/tips-for-success.md). We'll discuss some of these next week, and add to these as we progress.

Make sure you understand the first tip now \("don't hide when you don't know"\). If you have questions, let the volunteers know.

## Homework

As part of your learning journey with CYF you will be expected to work at home on projects that we set for you. This will help you practice what you learn on Sundays and get prepared for next week.

You will always be able to see a list of your homework assignments on Google Classroom.

For your first week of homework you will mostly be:

* working on a introduction to programming course and 
* preparing a very short presentation for the rest of the class

### Code.org Course 3

[Code.org](https://code.org) is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice.

It uses block-based coding \(we'll start JavaScript next week\). Don't be put off by the simplicity - even top universities teach block-based coding \(e.g. Berkeley & Harvard\).

We will be completing the course called "Course 3".

To get set up, follow these instructions:

1. Follow the instructions for registering a Code.org account provided by the instructors
2. Start by clicking on [item 1 from lesson "2. Maze"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1). \(Yes, you should skip lesson 1\). Let the instructors know if you get stuck - it will be harder for us to help when you're at home
3. Read the instructions carefully and try to complete all stages of ALL lessons **EXCEPT** the ones below

**SKIP** all of the lessons starting with these numbers:

* 1
* 4
* 9
* 10
* 18
* 19
* 20

\(All of the lessons starting with "Unplugged Activity"\)

Once you're finished, press submit in Google Classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your Code.org username.

### Prepare a presentation for the next class

Part of being a programmer is communicating your ideas to other people on your team. To help you practice this very important skill, for homework we want you to prepare a short \(5 minutes\) presentation about something you learned during the week. You can use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) if you want to prepare slides \(this is optional\).

Here is a list of topic ideas which you could present about:

* Why are the "Repeat" and "Repeat Until" blocks useful?
* Why are "Functions" useful?
* Why is the "Conditional" block useful?

If you want to present a different idea, that is fine as well. Then next week, you'll each present what you learned to a few students from the class.

### Learning How to Learn course

[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is a video course on the Coursera site that teaches you how to be the most effective at learning.

1. Click the "Join for Free" button and sign up for an account
2. Watch the videos in **Week 1** of the course. It should take around 4 hours to complete

### Write an "algorithm recipe"

Programming is all about writing _algorithms_. What is an algorithm?

1. Read this [section of a book](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway/blob/master/manuscript/intro02.md#introduction-to-algorithms)
2. Watch [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8) ðŸ˜„

These show "algorithm recipes", and the video shows that you have to think carefully when writing them!

Write your own "algorithm recipe" for your favourite food and submit it to Google Classroom. Next week we'll read some of the best algorithms to see if they have any missing steps!
