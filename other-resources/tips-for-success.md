# Tips for success

## Don't hide when you don't know.

* It is _normal_ not to know things as programmers
* The volunteers can't help you if we don't know you are lost
* Probably someone else in the class has the same question as you, and is too scared to ask
* If the teacher asks if everyone understands, SAY if you have doubts

## The goal is NOT to complete the exercises. The goal is to learn.

Completion of all exercises is _not_ success... if you do not truly understand.

If you learn so that you can complete any _future exercises_ without help \(e.g. in a job interview\), _that_ is success.

## When getting help, stay in control \(of the computer and the process\)

Each exercise is an _opportunity to learn_ - don't let anyone steal that from you by solving your problem. Completing the exercise without understanding is a _waste of your time and ours_.

## In group-work, seek to understand everything

If you've done something in group-work that you don't fully understand:

* Slow things down
* Get it explained
* Go back to it after by yourself, and challenge yourself to understand it

_Don't let it go_ because the next time you don't understand something, it will be harder to get things explained.

So if you solve 10 exercises together in a group-work exercise, it is a great idea to go back over and try to solve them yourself the next day.

## Take notes about what you don't understand

At a minimum, take note of the exercise numbers that you have problems with, even if you solve them eventually. Then you should revisit them some time afterwards and complete them again from scratch until you're positive you understand.

## Try _prediction_, to get all the juice out of each exercise!

With simple programming challenges, it is easy to just repeatedly modify and re-run your program until it works, but you won't learn much unless you are _thinking_ \(and this playful approach doesn't work with more complicated problems\), so instead...

Always try to _predict_ what your code will do before you run it. Write your prediction down, or tell your a friend - you can make it a game. After you run the program, if your guess was wrong, discuss why, then FIND OUT why.

## Don't be frustrated when a volunteer does not solve your problem for you

The instructors have told them not to! Can you say why?
